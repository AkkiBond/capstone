# YourSmartHome - Smart-Mart Team Contract

## Roles
Task Master: Jane
Git Master: Charles
Test Master: Nick

##Daily Process
* Standup at start of assigned block of time, meeting at end of session:
  * Otherwise we’ll schedule a time
* Pair programming through boiler plate, otherwise when necessary
* Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
* Slack announcements out when a given task is finished, make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master

##Team Expectations
* Sacred Times
  * 6-8:30pm
  * Sundays 
* If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrutping another's train of coding-thought
  * In general just slack first and we will each respond ASAP
* We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
* Hear each other out
  * Throwing ideas out
  * Suggesting ideas or alternatives
  * In general!
* There's no right way, but there are better ways
  * These are opportunities to learn and to teach!
* Keep each other posted on accomplishments and conflicts
  * Make sure no one is clueless about where the group is at

##Issues
* If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
  * Take a walk or get some water
  * Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
  * Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate
